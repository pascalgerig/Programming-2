## Step 1: Start

When launching the application, the user ends up on this screen. He can select 'exit' to exit the app, or 'new game' to proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Game parameters

Within this screen, various settings for the upcoming game can be defined. This includes the number of, and name of, participating players, the level's size, the number of walls available to each player etc.

A click on 'start' then starts the game.

## Step 3: Initial game state

In here, a graphical display at the top left shows, for each player, the number of walls he has available.

Each player's current location, as well as his target squares, are shown. The currently active player - marked by a green hue - can move by clicking on any of the arrow keys next to his character. These arrow keys only allow movement into valid directions.

Player X moves one square towards the right.

## Step 4: First move

After X has moved, it is now Y's turn.

He moves one square towards the left.

## Step 5: Second move

After Y moved, it is now X's turn.

He decides to place a wall, by first clicking on the little wall symbol to the top left of the character, then afterwards on the two squares where he wants to place his wall.

## Step 6: Wall placement

This step illustrates how a freshly placed wall is rendered, as well as how it impacts the other player's movement choices.

## Step 7: Game Over

This screen is shown after one of the two players has won.

A click on 'new game' will lead to a rematch, whereas a click on 'quit' brings the user back to the main menu.
